            <h2>Importance of Food Hygiene</h2>
            <p>Food hygiene is critical to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals. In hostels, where large numbers of students rely on shared meals, it becomes even more important. Proper handling, storage, and preparation of food are essential to prevent foodborne illnesses. Regular cleanliness of kitchens, proper refrigeration, and ensuring that food is cooked at the right temperature are key elements of food hygiene. Our commitment is to help hostels maintain the highest standards of food hygiene so students can enjoy healthy, safe meals.</p>

            <h2>What We Do!</h2>
            <p>We help hostels improve their food quality and hygiene by offering a platform to update and manage their local mess menus. With authentication, hostel students can access real-time, reliable information about the meals offered by their respective hostels. We work closely with hostel vendors to ensure the menus are accurate, up-to-date, and cater to the nutritional needs of students. Our goal is to make it easy for students to know what food is available, ensuring transparency and trust in the food they consume daily.</p>

            <h2>All About Food</h2>
            <p>Food is not just about filling our stomachs â€“ it's about nourishing our bodies. A balanced diet is essential for students, as it boosts energy, enhances concentration, and supports overall health. At our platform, we emphasize the importance of healthy, nutritious meals, offering suggestions and tips for meal planning. From vegetarian to non-vegetarian options, we believe that food should be diverse, satisfying, and supportive of every student's lifestyle. Whether you're craving a quick snack or a wholesome meal, we aim to provide options that meet all your needs!</p>
